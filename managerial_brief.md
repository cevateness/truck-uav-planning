# Hybrid Truck-Drone (“Horsefly”) Delivery: Business Case Snapshot

**Context**  
Last-mile accounts for > 50 % of total parcel cost.  Small UAVs can off-load parcels while a truck keeps rolling, a concept known as *horse-fly*. 

**Quantified upside**  
Monte-Carlo replication of Carlsson & Song’s model shows:

| Drone speed (vs. truck) | Route time cut |
|:--|:--|
| 1× | **–5 %**  (worse) |
| 2× | **–48 %** |
| ≥ 3× | **–50 %** (plateaus) |

Thus, a single drone yielding ≥ 3× road speed (~50 km/h truck ⇒ ≥ 150 km/h UAV) can halve driver hours on dense urban tours (≈200 stops within 10 km radius).

**When it pays**  
* Dense delivery clusters (≥ 100 drops / km²).  
* Drone sortie range ≤ 5 km; battery swap < 2 min.  
* Flexible customer windows or hand-off lockers (to absorb ±5 min variance).

**Operational watch-outs**  
* Regulations: BVLOS waivers and flight-corridor approvals determine rollout pace.  
* Battery logistics: swap/charge downtime eats into the 50 % gain if > 2 min per cycle.  
* Weather and line-of-sight failures demand fallback (truck-only) plan.

**Strategic next steps**  
1. **Pilot** in two high-density zip codes; instrument truck GPS and UAV telemetry to validate the 50 % time saving.  
2. **Sensitivity test** battery-swap handling time—benefit breaks even at ~2 min/launch.  
3. **Model extension**: evaluate two-UAV-per-truck scenario; CA results predict up to 65 % additional time cut but with more complex routing logic.
