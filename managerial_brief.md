# Hybrid Truck-Drone (“Horsefly”) Delivery: Business Case Snapshot

**Context**  
Last-mile accounts for > 50 % of total parcel cost.  Small UAVs can off-load parcels while a truck keeps rolling, a concept known as *horse-fly*. 

**Quantified upside**  
Monte-Carlo replication of Carlsson & Song’s model shows:

| Drone speed (vs. truck) | Route time cut |
|:--|:--|
| 1× | **–5 %**  (worse) |
| 2× | **–48 %** |
| ≥ 3× | **–50 %** (plateaus) |

Thus, a single drone yielding ≥ 3× road speed (~50 km/h truck ⇒ ≥ 150 km/h UAV) can halve driver hours on dense urban tours (≈200 stops within 10 km radius). It is assumed that 50 km h⁻¹ average truck speed on dense urban routes. Commercial drones above 120 km h⁻¹ remain experimental; gains beyond 2–2.5 × are therefore theoretical until faster platforms or fixed-wing VTOLs mature. Given current regulations (Part 107 & EASA U-space) and certified drone speeds ≤ 120 km h⁻¹, management should evaluate horse-fly pilots at the 2 × speed point, where our model still predicts a ~45–50 % time saving.

**When it pays**  
* Dense delivery clusters (≥ 100 drops / km²).  
* Drone sortie range ≤ 5 km; battery swap < 2 min.  
* Flexible customer windows or hand-off lockers (to absorb ±5 min variance).

**Operational critical watch-outs**  
* Regulations: BVLOS waivers and flight-corridor approvals determine rollout pace.  
* Battery logistics: swap/charge downtime eats into the 50 % gain if > 2 min per cycle.  
* Weather and line-of-sight failures demand fallback (truck-only) plan.


**Last word**

This is a *business case snapshot* for management to evaluate the horse-fly concept. There are critical operational and regulatory aspects that need to be investigated more throughly like battery swap, traffic management, and BVLOS waivers.
